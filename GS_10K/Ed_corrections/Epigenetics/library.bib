	Abstract = {Genome-wide, epigenome-wide and gene-environment association studies are plagued with the problems of confounding and causality. Although those problems have received considerable attention in each application field, no consensus have emerged on which approaches are the most appropriate to solve this problem. Current methods use approximate heuristics for estimating confounders, and often ignore correlation between confounders and primary variables, resulting in suboptimal power and precision. In this study, we developed a least-squares estimation theory of confounder estimation using latent factor models, providing a unique framework for several categories of genomic data. Based on statistical learning methods, the proposed algorithms are fast and efficient, and they were proven to provide optimal solutions mathematically. In simulations, the algorithms outperformed commonly used methods based on principal components and surrogate variable analysis. In analysis of methylation profiles and genotypic data, they provided new insights on the molecular basis on diseases and adaptation of humans to their environment. Software is available in the R package lfmm at https://bcm-uga.github.io/lfmm/.},

The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features.

	Abstract = {Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to periodontal disease, but the underlying susceptibility pathways are not fully understood. Epigenetic mechanisms are malleable regulators of gene function that can change in response to genetic and environmental stimuli, thereby providing a potential mechanism for mediating risk effects in periodontitis. The aim of this study is to identify epigenetic changes across tissues that are associated with periodontal disease.},

@article{Aryee2014,
abstract = {Motivation: The recently released Infinium HumanMethylation450 array (the ‚Äò450k' array) provides a high-throughput assay to quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) at ‚àº450 000 loci across a range of genomic features. Although less comprehensive than high-throughput sequencing-based techniques, this product is more cost-effective and promises to be the most widely used DNAm high-throughput measurement technology over the next several years.Results: Here we describe a suite of computational tools that incorporate state-of-the-art statistical techniques for the analysis of DNAm data. The software is structured to easily adapt to future versions of the technology. We include methods for preprocessing, quality assessment and detection of differentially methylated regions from the kilobase to the megabase scale. We show how our software provides a powerful and flexible development platform for future methods. We also illustrate how our methods empower the technology to make discoveries previously thought to be possible only with sequencing-based methods.Availability and implementation:http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/minfi.html.Contact:khansen@jhsph.edu; rafa@jimmy.harvard.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
